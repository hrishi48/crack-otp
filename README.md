This is a simple algorithm that can break a one time pad.

The one time pad is the most secure cryptographic algorithm. But the drawbacks are that it can only be used once and the secret key is as long as the message itself.
if the key is used more than once then the cryptography would break. This algorithm exploits this vulnerability. By intercepting a bunch of cipher texts, it can decipher
the secret key and hence decipher all past and future messages that would use the same key.
